# Sorting of an array of object

You should implement the `Task.sort()` method which takes the: `Node[] list` argument and sort it in ascending order. Nodes should be sorted by theis `number` field (the node with a smaller number should be the first).  
The sorting should keep the initial order of nodes with the same `number`. It means that if two nodes have the same `number` they should be in the same order as in the input array. 

Pay attention: the method should sort the input array but now return the new one.
