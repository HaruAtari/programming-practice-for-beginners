# Searching for the intersection of two lists of integers

You should implement the `List<Integer> Task.findIntersection(List<Integer> x, List<Integer> y)` method which takes two
lists of integers and return a list of values that occur in both input lists.

Pay attention: The input lists don't contain duplicates (it means that all integers within each input list are unique).
So you can meet each integer only once (if it's in one list only) or twice (if it's in both lists).
