# Calculating the distance between two points on the coordinates plane

You should implement the `double Calculator.calculateDistance(Point point1, Point point2)` method which takes two points
on the coordinates plane and return the shortest distance between them. You should find the formula for distance
calculation by yourself. Each point is an instance of the `Point` class which has the `int x` and `int y` fields.

The result is checked to 4 decimal digit.
