# Merging arrays of integers

You should implement the `Task.merge()` method which takes two arguments: `int[] x` and `int[] y`. It should return the
single array on integers which contains all elements from both input arrays.  
Elements of the `x` array should be placed before elements from the `y` array.  
Also all elements should keep their order from the source arrays.
