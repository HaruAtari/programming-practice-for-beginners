# Searching for mix and max in ar array of integers

You should implement the next methods:

- The `Task.min()` method which takes the `int[] list` argument and returns a minimal value from that list.
- The `Task.max()` method which takes the `int[] list` argument and returns a maximal value from that list.

Both methods should return `0` if the input array is empty.
