# Searching by value in an array

You should implement the next methods:

- The `Task.findFirst()` method which takes two arguments: `int[] list` and `int value`. It should search for
  the `value` in the `list` array and return the index of the *first* found element.
- The `Task.findLast()` method which takes two arguments: `int[] list` and `int value`. It should search for the `value`
  in the `list` array and return the index of the *last* found element.

If the `value` element doesn't exist in the `list` array the methods should return `-1`.
