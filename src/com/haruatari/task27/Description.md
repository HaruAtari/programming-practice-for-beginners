# Searching for unique values in the list of integers

You should implement the `List<Integer> Task.getUnique(List<Integer> list)` method which takes a list of integers. This
list can contain duplicates (element with the same value)

Pay attention: The input lists don't contain duplicates (it means that all integers within each input list are unique).
So you can meet each integer only once (if it's in one list only) or twice (if it's in both lists).
